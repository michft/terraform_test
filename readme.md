Terraform Test
--------------

This is a coding test I did to show that I can work with Terraform and AWS.

* Creates a EC2 autoscaling group of 1, 
* S3 bucket and 
* Other networking goodness.
* Produces a file from some meta-data and writes file to the S3 bucket using assumed roles.

Should be broken up, but the request was for a monolithic file.
